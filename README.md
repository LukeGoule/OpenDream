# OpenDream
 
OpenDream is an open source "dream machine" written in C++, utilising DirectX 10 and ImGui to produce strange, almost fully psychedelic effects in your vision. The current belief is that waves somewhere between 8hz and 15hz can stimulate a hypnagogic state within the mind, leading to the brain producing patterns not too dissimilar to what may be seen when suddenly waking up from light sleep.

## Getting Started

### Downloading precompiled binaries
1) Download from https://github.com/LukeGoule/OpenDream/releases
2) Extract ALL the files into the same directory. The program will not function without the .cso files.
3) Ensure you have the DirectX 10 and VC++2019 end-user redistributables installed. 
3) Run OpenDream.exe

### Compiling from source
1) Download ImGui from https://github.com/ocornut/imgui and extract into the same folder as the source code (imgui-master should be in the same folder as WinMain.cpp)
2) Ensure your installation of DirectX 10 is functional, make sure you have the runtime binaries installed.
3) Preferable compile in 64 bit.
4) Have fun.
